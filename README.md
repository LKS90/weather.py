Weather.py
==========

A simple "single page application" written in python, using Flask as the web-server.
It uses the https://openweathermap.org data to display the current weather as well as forecasts for the day and a general forecast of the following five days during the morning, day and night.
Since a static color background is very boring, it also updates the background with a random picture from the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day archive.

The icons are from this source: http://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/
